<h1> Talk with fraudsters</h1>


<p>
On a cold Thursday evening, around 4 PM, I got a call from +91 70657 48451 and a girl started saying that 
I got below mentioned HDFC policy and it got expired.

<br>
<br>
After explaining me a lot of details, she told me that now my whole case has been transferred to my RM 
( so called Rahul Sharma,  9540419791), who sits in Navi Mumbai branch. So if I need to take some action, 
I should immideatly call my RM.

and call me back

After 5 minutes, I got a call from him. He told that he has looked into my policy and it is in termination mode. 
He also added that for this policy, premium of 50K was paid only in 2013 and after that no other premium got 
received. Currently, policy is in lapsed condition with a total fund value of 1.4 lakhs. Now I have got following 
options for this policy 
  
<br>

<ul>
 <li>Revival Option: For this I have to pay remaining premium of 3 Lakhs + 27K as fine </li>   
 <li>Settlement Option: For this, I have to 1 Lakhs because of 3 years of lock-in period prescribed by IRDA. And Once 
    I do this, I can expect a payment of 2.4 Lakhs after 90 days  </li>
<li>Termination Option: In this scenario, I will get 5K in return  </li>
</ul>

<h4>
<em>Obviously, Option 2 was a go to option as it provides the quick money with some initial investment.</em>

<p>
So I told him that I would like to go with option 2. On this, guy explained me that he needs to get approval 
from IRDA and needs to send a mail to IRDA. He asked me about IRDA, and I though that if I say no, then it makes 
me look like a fool, so I said Yes. He then added, generally, for such queries an approval is received quicky and 
is only valid for 2 hours. If no action is being taken within those 2 hours, then none of the option can be worked 
out in future. I nodded and he asked me to wait. This reduces my anxiety and made me calm.

    <strong>
        Now let me tell you one important thing. I never had such a policy and the first moment that girl called me, I knew it was a fake call. But I though to continue with it as I was thinking to approach police and get them caught. 
    </strong>
</p>

<hr>

<p>
With a feeling to do something good, I headed to my car and drove it to nearest police station. The first cop I met 
asked my about my place where I live and based on that he asked me to go to a different police station. 

I sat in my car again and drove to that another police station. On entering, I enquired about the room where I 
can get this reported. But policeman standing there asked me to go to cyber police station to report these kinds 
of crime as technologically they are not that much equipped. 

</p>

<hr>


<p>
I put on my car and headed to that another station. In between, I got a call from 7291899483 and he told me that 
my approval has come from IRDA and asked me to note down my approval number.

<p>
On entering the premise I asked the guard about the place where I can report my complain. He asked me to go to first 
floor. I went there, entered in a room and saw a policeman. He was talking to someone. Initially I waited for 
2 minutes, but then I just intercepted their discussion and asked him about reporting cyber fraud. He asked about 
about my case and then I explained him everything about call and then he told me that they are already working on 
these kinds of cases. He himself gets these kinds of call. 

</p>

<p>
 In between I got a final call from fraudster for payment   
</p>

<p>
So are recommended me to block such numbers and not 
entertain these guys. Reasoning he gave me is that these people are calling everyone one i.e. Him, his seniors, 
judges and others and who know they might be calling PM or presidents also. So the best way to deal with such 
calls is to say no or block or just yell on them with some ‘Galli’.  Hearing all this, I thought 

<h2>
    <center><strong>“Yes, it’s true. The responsibility still lies on us to keep ourself aware, read newspaper and watch news. </strong></center>

</h2>

<hr>

<p>
    <h2>But I still have some of these questions in my head for which I am seeking some answers </h2>

    <ul>
        <li> Who’s responsible for our data privacy? Banking, Financial Institutes, Insurance institutes, Police or Us.</li>
        <li>If our data is being leaked and some fraud happens then who will pay? </li>
        <li>Government is talking about #cashless economy. Are we all ready to shift to it? When there is no clear law and actions</li>
    </ul>
</p>

At last while leaving I saw this board hanging in the cyber police station.
